# Nutriplus

This is a college project developed during our software engineering class. We devised a web application to help nutritionists plan their patients' diet. It can calculate a patient's daily intake of nutrients. If the nutritionist think the result is correct, the system will aks permissiont to generate a suggestion of a diet base on such data.

In addition, nutrtionits are able to plan a diet themselves on our application and use the latter to find substitions of meals that have the same amount of nutrients as the one they devised.

To run the back end of our application, first enter the folder ´´´´nutriplus_back´´´, install the dependencies by running the command:

´´´pip install requirements.txt´´´

Then, to start the server, run

´´´
python manage.py runserver
´´´
